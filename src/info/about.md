## Origins of this blog

I’ve always loved writing, even before my web development days.
While learning web development, sites like <a href="">CSS Tricks</a>, <a href="">Smashing Magazine</a> and <a href="">A List Apart</a> were an enormous help and inspiration to me, and I appreciated the clear, high-quality articles, written by some of the best minds in
the business. (I’ve been lucky enough to write for two of those
three publications!)

One of the things I love about being a web developer is the great sense of community. Although it’s not without its problems, for the most part people love sharing knowledge and are willing to help each other out. I started writing for the web partly to be be a part of this knowledge-sharing community, and partly to help with my own learning. Many of my articles came about through learning something new and wanting to record it, and they are resources that I refer back to.

In 2018 I got really interested in CSS Grid Layout and custom properties, and wrote an article on using them together, which I published as a post on Codepen. It ended up being a really popular article (certainly by my standards at the time, anyway!). I was excited that I was able to help people discover new things to do with CSS. A couple more articles later, I got the idea of starting my own blog. While publishing on Codepen was a good way to reach a lot of people, I liked the idea of having my own little corner of the internet to publish on.

Thus, CSS In Real Life was born, as both a website and a Twitter handle, with the goal of sharing my front-end learnings (and leaning heavily towards CSS).

## Why “in real life”?
