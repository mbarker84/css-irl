This past week has brought a few announcements from browser vendors of some exciting things that might have a big impact on CSS layout in the very near future.

## Chrome previews a new Grid inspector

Iâ€™ve long been a fan of Firefoxâ€™s Grid inspector. Other browsers just donâ€™t come close when it comes to debugging CSS layout - until now.

This week Chrome teased us with a sneak-preview of a brand new Grid inspector, which might even rival Firefoxâ€™s. No more squinting and counting line numbers â€“ Chromeâ€™s inspector shows them to you! Although Iâ€™m a Firefox girl at heart, Iâ€™ll still be giving it a whirl â€“ and itâ€™ll certainly make debugging in Chrome easier.

From Twitter:

## â€˜gapâ€™ for flexbox supported in Chrome Canary

Again, Chrome is playing catch-up to Firefox on this one. The `gap` property has been supported in Grid layout for a while (previously `grid-gap`), but now it can be used in flexbox too. This makes building [algorithmic layouts](https://every-layout.dev/blog/algorithmic-design/) a lot easier - no more hacking around with margins.

This is currently behind a flag in Chrome Canary â€“ youâ€™ll need to enable it.

From [Adam Argyle](https://twitter.com/argyleink) on Twitter:

## Masonry in Firefox Nightly

This is a big one, and kind of blindsided me. [Masonry layouts](https://css-tricks.com/piecing-together-approaches-for-a-css-masonry-layout/) are something which, as a developer, Iâ€™m asked to implement _all_ the time, but which are (currently) only possible using Javascript. There are some ways you can _kind of_ do a similar thing with pure CSS [(hereâ€™s one)](https://codepen.io/michellebarker/pen/mdyYxGG), but all of them have their limitations, such as requiring a fixed height on the parent container, or knowing the height of your grid items in advance.

To be able to do this in CSS has always felt like a distant dream. But [Miriam Suzanne](https://twitter.com/MiriSuzanne) just announced that masonry grids are being tested in Firefox Nightly!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Masonry&quot; Grids are being tested in Firefox Nightly, behind a feature flag. <br><br>1. go to &quot;about:config&quot;<br>2. toggle &quot;layout.css.grid-template-masonry-value.enabled&quot;<br>3. try it out!<a href="https://t.co/65EW1jOMfi">https://t.co/65EW1jOMfi</a><a href="https://t.co/psOFPVLRk1">https://t.co/psOFPVLRk1</a></p>&mdash; [Mia | Miriam] Suzanne?

Itâ€™s still likely to be a long road to widespread browser support â€“ weâ€™re still waiting on other browsers to follow Firefoxâ€™s lead and work on [subgrid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid) support, six months down the line. But I really think this has the potential to be a game -changer â€“ almost as much as subgrid. In fact, I would say that I need to build masonry layouts more often than I build layouts that would require subgrid, given that I can usually work around the lack of subgrid support with nested grids and a bit of maths (although itâ€™s far from ideal).

Itâ€™s great to see the kind of progress being made on CSS layout. Letâ€™s hope these features become mainstream soon!
