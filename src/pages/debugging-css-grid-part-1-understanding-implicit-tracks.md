When observing people getting to grips with CSS Grid, I’ve noticed a few issues that catch people out more often than others, or present more of a challenge when it comes to building a layout. This short series of articles will delve into these common problems and aim to provide a better understanding of Grid so that you can anticipate layout problems, and debug them more easily when they occur.

## Accidental implicit tracks

The biggest issue I’ve seen people struggle with is accidentally creating extra grid tracks, which can throw an entire layout into disarray. These extra tracks are known as _implicit_ tracks, and they are created by placing an item outside of the _explicit_ grid’s boundary. To get the most out of Grid, it’s a good idea to understand the concepts of the _explicit_ and _implicit_ grid, and their relationship to each other.

### The explicit grid

The explicit grid is defined using the `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` properties (or shorthand `grid-template` if you prefer):

```css
.grid {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 150px);
	grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
}
```

Here we’re defining a grid with four rows and four columns, and we can know that our grid will have _at least_ four rows and four columns, no matter what. Even if we don’t have any grid children to place, so that our grid is completely empty, it will still take up the space of four rows and four columns that we’ve defined above.

If we used `repeat(4, auto)` for the `grid-template-rows` property, our grid rows would all have a height of `auto` – so if we had no grid children then our rows would still exist, they would just collapse down to a height of zero without any content to fill them. If we added a row gap (e.g. `row-gap: 40px`) then the combined height of the gaps between the rows would make up the height of our grid – so without any content it might look like an extra large margin or padding value somewhere that was breaking your layout!

### What are implicit tracks?

Implicit tracks are tracks that are only created by placing items. This behaviour in Grid is intentional, and very useful. An example is if you have a grid with four columns that we want to fill with an indeterminate number of items (e.g. a news feed. If we don’t know the number of items, we won’t know how many rows we need for the grid. By default, grid items are placed into the next available grid cell. We can simply omit the `grid-template-rows` property and allow Grid’s auto-placement to create the right number of rows for our content.

(Side note: I’m assuming here that the grid is using the default `grid-auto-flow: row`. If you change this to `grid-auto-flow: column` then implicit tracks will be created on the row axis instead.)

```css
.grid {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
}
```

<figure>
  <img src="debugging-css-grid-1_03.png" alt="Seven grid items laid out over two rows">
	<figcaption>Our grid has four columns. The items fill the first row, then a new one is created.</figcaption>
</figure>

We can control the behaviour of implicit tracks with `grid-auto-rows` and `grid-auto-columns`.

```css
.grid {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 150px);
	grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
	grid-auto-rows: 150px;
}
```

The above code, in addition to defining four explicit column and row tracks, instructs Grid that any implicit row tracks created should have a fixed height of 150px. This property is optional, and without it any implicit tracks will have a default size of `auto`.

### Placing items

To place an item on the grid we’ve just created, we could do something like this:

```css
.item {
	grid-column: 1 / 4;
	grid-row: 3 / 5;
}
```

We’re using start and end lines to place the grid item at the bottom left of our grid.

<figure>
  <img src="debugging-css-grid-1_06.png" alt="Orange grid item placed at the bottom left of the grid">
</figure>

This is not going to cause any problems because we are explicitly placing items by grid line number. We know that our grid has four rows and four columns (therefore five grid lines in either direction), so we’re unlikely to accidentally to unintentionally use a higher line number and accidentally create implicit tracks.

Alternatively, we could use the _span_ keyword in place of a start or end line:

```css
.item {
	grid-column: 1 / 4;
	grid-row: 3 / span 2;
}
```

I like using `span` for grid placement – it’s often helpful when you know an item needs to span a set number of grid tracks, rather than end at a specific line – but it means you can sometimes lose track of which grid line you’re placing an item on.

Here we’re using `span` in place of the `grid-row-end` line. If we change the _span_ value to 3 instead of 2, this would cause the item span more row tracks than there are available – and whoops! We’ve created an implicit track!

<figure>
  <img src="debugging-css-grid-1_04.png" alt="Orange grid item placed at the bottom left of the grid">
</figure>

I see this problem occur quite frequently in situations that require grid items to overlap each other. This is because Grid places items that aren’t explicitly placed in the next available grid cell, and if there isn’t a grid cell available then it will create implicit tracks rather than stack items on top of each other. This behaviour is very useful as it means we don’t always need to explicitly place items, but this is one case where it’s not particularly helpful to us!

A friend of mine was using Grid to position two elements, one on top of the other, but offset by one row:

<figure>
  <img src="debugging-css-grid-1_01.png" alt="A grid layout with two overlapping items">
</figure>

This is the code that was used to create the layout:

```css
.grid {
	grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}

.item:first-child {
	grid-column: span 3;
	grid-row: 1 / span 2;
}

.item:nth-child(2) {
	grid-column: span 3;
	grid-row: 2 / span 2;
}
```

Instead of the desired layout, we get this:

<figure>
  <img src="debugging-css-grid-1_02.png" alt="A grid layout with the second item pushed to the right">
</figure>

What has happened to the second item? Can you spot the problem here? Both items are using the _span_ keyword for the `grid-column` value. The first item will be positioned correctly because it will be auto-placed in the first available cell with a span of 3. The second item doesn’t have a start or end line, so Grid needs to resolve this, which it does by generating implicit column tracks.

If the grid had four explicit rows then the item would wrap to the next line (which wouldn’t be the layout we want, but would perhaps be less baffling!), but as their aren’t enough rows available then Grid resolves this by placing the item starting at line 5 on the column axis and generating four implicit tracks. Because we’re not using `grid-auto-columns` to define a size for our implicit tracks, these will have a default size of `auto`. And if the grid item has no content, then those tracks will collapse down to a width of 0, rendering our item invisible. Our grid item contains a heading, so these implicit tracks will be auto-sized to accommodate this.

If we had a `column-gap` value of, say, `20px`, we would see the width of two column gaps be added to our grid, although the tracks themselves would be zero.

Play with the demo below to explore different ways of “breaking” the layout:

## Preventing our layouts breaking

So, how can we best avoid running into problems with implicit tracks? One way is to understand how Grid is calculating our layout behind the scenes.

### Understanding the Grid Item Placement Algorithm

This sounds scarier than it really is! The [Grid Item Placement Algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#auto-placement-algo) is the order in which the placement of grid items is resolved. Grid items that are explicitly positioned first, followed by the items with a definite row position, then the browser determines the columns in the implicit grid and places any auto-placed items (items without an explicit position) accordingly. This is assuming the `grid-auto-flow` property value is `row` (the default). Keeping this in mind can help you to understand why you might have implicit tracks being created on one axis and not the other, if this is contrary to your expectations.

I also have a few tips for ways you to place items than can help avoid accidentally pushing items off the explicit grid...

### Naming grid lines

One way that helps me be more intentional with my grid placement is naming grid lines. Let’s say the item we want to place is an image. We could do this:

```css
.grid {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-rows:
		repeat(2, 150px) [image-start] repeat(2, 150px)
		[image-end];
	grid-template-columns: [image-start] repeat(3, 1fr) [image-end] 1fr;
	grid-auto-rows: 150px;
}
```

Using _-start_ and _-end_ as a suffix for our line names creates a grid area, which makes placing our image very simple:

```css
.image {
	grid-area: image;
}
```

You can also use the `grid-template-areas` property to do a similar thing, which feels more intuitive to many people – just bear in mind that won’t work if you need overlapping grid items.

### Placing by end line

Sometimes placing by end line number (as opposed to start line number) can help avoid the problem of creating accidental implicit tracks. Taking our example above, perhaps we know that we want the image to span three grid tracks, so we’re using the _span_ keyword as the `grid-column-end` value. But it might be better to use _span_ as the `grid-column-start` value and explicitly place it on its end line:

```css
.image {
	/* The image will end at line 4 on the column axis: */
	grid-column: span 3 / 4;
}
```

This can be helpful if we have a very large grid. Imagine our grid has 20 columns instead of just four, we might know that it needs to be placed one line away from the end, but we don’t want to have to calculate what the start line should be each time – that would be annoying and prone to error!

### Negative grid lines

A technique I find very useful (and something I’ve [written about before](/negative-grid-lines/)), is using negative line numbers to place grid items. Negative line number represent the lines of your grid in reverse. So in a grid of four tracks (which would have five grid lines), line -1 is the equivalent to line 5, line -2 is the equivalent to line 4, and so on.

Again, this can come in very handy when working with a large grid. If we know and item needs to align to the end of the grid then we can simply use grid line -1, instead of having to remember that the last line is line 21, for example.

### Debugging with dev tools

I thoroughly recommend the Firefox dev tools for inspecting and debugging problems with CSS Grid. The [grid inspector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Examine_grid_layouts) allows you to switch on line numbers, so even if the sizes of your implicit tracks have collapsed right down to zero you will still be able to see that they have been created. (The inspector also shows you the negative line numbers – very handy!)

## Conclusion
