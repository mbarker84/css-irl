The web today feels quite polarised. Web standards advocates seem to be at perpetual loggerheads with framework developers, and new arguments errupt on Twitter almost daily. But plugging away amongst all the noise are many, many incredibly talented developers, simply building wonderful things that make my heart soar. There are so many people sharing demos, articles and talks that provide a dopamine hit of inspiration and blow away any grey clouds.

I’d like to share some of the things that have been inspiring me, in what I hope will be a semi-regular collection here on the blog. I hope they’ll inspire you too!

### [Notes from An Event Apart](https://hookedoncode.com/category/an-event-apart-2019/)

by [Torre Capistran](http://hookedoncode.com)

Every [An Event Apart]() always looks like the best conference I’ve never been to. Helpfully, Torre Capistran of [Hooked on Code](https://hookedoncode.com) has been blogging about _every_ talk from this year’s AEADC! These are among the best and most thorough conference notes I’ve read. [Animation on the Bleeding Edge](https://hookedoncode.com/2019/07/animation-on-the-bleeding-edge-by-sarah-drasner/) by [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) is one of those giving me an inspiration hit right now!
