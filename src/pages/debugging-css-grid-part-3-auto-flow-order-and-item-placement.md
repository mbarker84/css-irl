When it comes to building a layout, CSS Grid offers us a number of different choices for placing items. In this article we’ll take a look at the different placement methods, how to use auto-flow to avoid having to explicitly place every item, and why sometimes grid items might not be placed where you expect them to be.

I like to think of using Grid as two distinct parts:

1. Scaffolding – or building the structure of the grid itself. This involves defining the properties acting on the grid container, beginning with `display: grid`, and describing the shape of the grid and how it should behave using any combination of `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, `grid-auto-columns` and `grid-auto-rows` (or `grid` / `grid-template` if using the shorthand).
2. Furnishing the grid – telling the browser where each child of our grid container should be placed.

In this article we’ll take a deeper look at the second part, and in particular auto placement.

## Different ways to place a grid item

### Explicit placement

The properties that allow us to explicitly place items on a grid are:

- `grid-column-start`
- `grid-column-end`
- `grid-row-start`
- `grid-row-end`
- `grid-column` (shorthand for `grid-column-start` / `grid-column-end`)
- `grid-row` (shorthand for `grid-row-start` / `grid-row-end`)
- `grid-area` (shorthand for `grid-row-start` / `grid-column-start` / `grid-row-end` / `grid-column-end`)

The above properties are defined on the _items_ themselves. Possible values include line numbers, line names, span values or area names. There are no rules for which you should and shouldn’t use, and you can mix and match as you like. For example:

```css
.item--a {
	grid-area: a;
}

.item--b {
	grid-area: 2 / 2 / 4 / 4;
}

.item--c {
	grid-row: span 2 / 5;
	grid-column: 1 / 3;
}
```

### grid-template-areas

Additionally, we have `grid-template-areas`. This property it is defined on the _grid container_. It allows us to define grid areas with names, then reference those areas to place the items:

```css
.grid {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
	grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 120px);
	grid-template-areas:
		'a a a'
		'. b b'
		'. b b'
		'. . .';
}

.a {
	grid-area: a;
}

.b {
	grid-area: b;
}
```

This is pretty cool, as it means we could change the layout significantly by only altering the `grid-template-areas` value. We don’t need to add or change any properties on the items themselves. A big win for responsive design!

We might be tempted to place every item explicitly using `grid-template-areas`. But there’s one drawback: You can’t define overlapping areas. Creating a layout like _Fig 01_ could not be done with `grid-template-areas` alone.

<figure>
  <img src="debugging-css-grid-3-01.png" alt="A grid with three items">
	<figcaption><em>Fig 01</em><span>Items 2 and 3 overlap, so only one can have its area defined by `grid-template-areas`.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

But we _could_ use `grid-template-areas` _in addition_ to placing items by line name or area.

```css
.a {
	grid-area: a;
}

.b {
	grid-area: b;
}

.c {
	grid-area: 3 / 1 / 5 / 3;
}
```

### Auto placement

If we don’t explicity place items on our grid, they will be auto-placed. By default each grid items have a span of 1 on both the row and the column axis, so they will each be placed into the next available grid cell. We can use this to our advantage: If we have something like a news feed, we don’t want to have to place each item explicitly, especially if we don’t know how many items there will be.

<figure>
  <img src="debugging-css-grid-3-02.png" alt="Auto placement">
	<figcaption><em>Fig 02</em><span>No items are explicity placed, therefore they are all auto placed.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

## Predicting auto placement

In the above example the rules of auto placement are fairly intuitive: Items are placed along the row (or inline) axis until they fill up the row, and then they’ll wrap onto the next row (creating a new row if there isn’t one defined).

But if we have some items that are explicity placed, and others that are not, them how can we identify the cells the auto placed be placed into?

If I place an item on my grid using `grid-column: 2 / span 2` I might expect that any auto placed items succeeding that one will be placed _after_ the one I’m placing (_Fig 03_):

<figure>
  <img src="debugging-css-grid-3-03.png" alt="Three grid items with a mixture of explicit and auto placement">
	<figcaption><em>Fig 03</em><span>The blue item is explicitly placed on the row and column axis (using `grid-template-columns` and grid-template-columns`).</span></figcaption>
</figure>

What _actually_ happens with the above code is the succeeding items are placed _before_ the placed item. They are placed into the first available cells, which happen to be the first two in our grid.

<figure>
  <img src="debugging-css-grid-3-04.png" alt="Three grid items with a mixture of explicit and auto placement">
	<figcaption><em>Fig 04</em><span>The blue item is explicitly placed only on the column axis (using grid-template-columns`).</span></figcaption>
</figure>

But if we place the blue item only on the column axis, the items _are_ placed after the first one:

<figure>
  <img src="debugging-css-grid-3-05.png" alt="Three grid items with a mixture of explicit and auto placement">
	<figcaption><em>Fig 05</em><span>The blue item is placed on the column axis with `grid-column: 2 / 4`.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

So why is the placement behaviour different? If we understand the rules of auto placement, things become clearer.

## Understanding flow

A good way to think about this is to think of our grid as a flowing river. Any explicitly placed items are boats anchored in the river. Auto placed items flow around these, from left to right (_Fig 06_).

<figure>
  <img src="debugging-css-grid-3-06.png" alt="Grid items with a mixture of explicit and auto placement">
	<figcaption><em>Fig 06</em></figcaption>
</figure>

Grid items that are only explicitly placed on one axis are more loosly anchored. They participate in the grid flow on the remaining axis.

Items placed using a span value alone will still flow like the others, but they’ll be restricted by their own explicit size. An item with a span of 2 will flow onto the next row if there are less than 2 grid columns available. We can think of these as being semi-auto placed (_Fig 07_).

<figure>
  <img src="debugging-css-grid-3-07a.png" alt="Grid items with a mixture of explicit and auto placement">
	<figcaption><em>Fig 07</em> Item 2 has a column span of 3, so will wrap onto the next line.</figcaption>
</figure>

In _Fig 07_ we’re only placing the item on the column axis again (using `span`), so successive items are placed after it. We have enough items to fill the grid exactly – but rather than filling earlier grid cell, the sixth and seventh items create an implicit track. This _doesn’t_ happen if we only place it explicitly on the row axis (_Fig 08_).

<figure>
  <img src="debugging-css-grid-3-08a.png" alt="Auto placed items filling up the explicit grid">
	<figcaption><em>Fig 08</em><span>Item 2 has a row span of 3</span></figcaption>
</figure>

This is to do with the order in which item placement is resolved in the [grid placement algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#auto-placement-algo).

## Changing the flow of your grid

There are two different properties we can use to change the order of items in the grid. The first is `grid-auto-flow`. This changes the direction of flow, and therefore how items will be auto placed. Possible values are `row` (default), `column`, `row dense` and `column dense`.

### grid-auto-flow: column

By changing the value from `row` to `column`, we can see in the second section in this demo that the behaviour has now reversed: Items placed on the column axis are now resolved ahead of those on the row axis. Placing an item on the column axis no longer generates an implicit grid track, as items are packed into every cell, but placing an item on the row axis _does_.

### grid-auto-flow: dense

Using the `dense` keyword in addition to `row` or `column` (`row` is the default), we can
specify that auto placed items should pack themselves into any available grid cells (including ones preceeding any explicitly placed items). This will ensure there are no gaps, even if an item is placed on only one axis. In the above demo you can see how each of the values for `grid-auto-flow` alter the behaviour of the grid.

### Order

The `order` property is not exclusive to Grid – it can also be used with flexbox. It allows us to change the order of individual items within the flow. Items have a default order of 0. Changing an auto placed item’s order to -1 will place it at the start of the grid auto placed grid items – after explicitly placed items, if there are any placed at the start of the grid.

The `order` property will only affect auto and semi-auto placed items (those using a single span value). In the demo below the purple item’s position is altered using the `order` property, but the blue item, which is explicitly placed, is not affected.

### Direction

You might have noticed, `grid-auto-flow` allows us to change the direction of flow from `row` to `column`, but it does not allow us to make items flow from right to left. Instead, we can use the `direction` property. This is part of the [CSS Writing Modes](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/), which is designed to support international writing modes where text flows in a different direction from left-to-right. To make our grid flow from right to left we can use this:

```css
.grid {
	direction: rtl;
}
```

### ⚠️ Use with caution ⚠️

Properties that affect the visual order of grid items should be used with the utmost caution, as the do no change the source order and can therefore adversely affect accessibility. Rachel Andrew has written extensively about it in her article, [Grid, content re-ordering and accessibility](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2019/06/04/grid-content-re-ordering-and-accessibility).

I believe there are _some_ cases where visual re-ordering makes sense, but in my experience they most often involve explicit item placement.

## Conclusion

I hope this article has helped demystify some issues around placement of auto flow grid items.
