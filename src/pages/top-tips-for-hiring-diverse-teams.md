Like many women in tech, I sometimes get asked how companies can recruit a more diverse team. It’s not secret that the tech world is very male-dominated. While I don’t have a magic bullet, I have my own experience of seeking employment in the tech industry, and consequently I have a few opinions on what companies could be doing better in order to attract more diverse applicants.

Please note, these tips specifically relate to my experience as a woman in a male-dominated field. I am aware that diversity encompasses much more than that, and that people of colour, trans people, LGBTQ+ people and people with disabilities frequently experience discrimination, and to greater degrees. I can only speak to my own experiences, but if you are a person from a marginalised group and would like to add your voice to this article, please reach out and I will be more than happy to make some edits.

So, here are my top tips for hiring diverse teams:

## Acknowledge the problem

If you’ve read this far, congratulations – you’re probably someone who _cares_ about having a diverse team, and that’s the first step! Many people don’t want to ackowledge the issue at all, and don’t see having a team dominated by young, white males as a problem. There are lots of reasons why we _should_ care, but one of them is that hiring only people with similar life experiences to you, is at best limiting and at worst outright dangerous.
