Like many women in tech, I sometimes get asked how companies can recruit a more diverse team. It’s no secret that the tech world is very male-dominated. While I don’t have a magic bullet, I have my own experience of seeking employment in the tech industry, and consequently I have a few opinions on what companies could be doing better in order to attract more diverse applicants. As in so many cases, making something better for a minority of people also has the bonus effect of making it better for _everyone_. So there’s really no excuse not to implement these tips.

Please note, these tips specifically relate to my experience as a female front-end developer in a male-dominated field. I am aware that diversity encompasses much more than that, and that people of colour, trans people, LGBTQ+ people and people with disabilities frequently experience discrimination, and to greater degrees. I can only speak to my own experiences, but if you are a person from a marginalised group and would like to add your voice to this article, please reach out and I will be more than happy to make some edits.

So, here are my top tips for hiring diverse teams:

## Acknowledge the problem

If you’ve read this far, congratulations – you’re probably someone who _cares_ about having a diverse team, and that’s the first step! Many people don’t want to ackowledge the issue at all, and don’t see having a team dominated by young, white males as a problem. There are lots of reasons why we _should_ care, but one of them is that hiring only people with similar life experiences to you, is at best limiting and at worst outright dangerous. A team with a restricted collective experience is less likely to spot problems, oversights or design issues that impact those with different life experiences and, as a consequence, is more likely to perpetuate these problems by implementing inconsiderate products.

## Be an ally

Recruiting diversely isn’t always easy in the tech industry, as the pool of candidates is overwhelmingly white and male. But companies who care about diversity, and are actively making an effort to attract and retain a diverse workforce feel far more welcoming than the ones that look (from the outside) like an all boys club. Companies that are advocating, mentoring and sponsoring (for example) women in tech initiatives are more attractive, and those that are visibly putting into practice anti-discrimination policies (e.g. in their job descriptions) and stamping out bad behaviour are even better.

Go along to meetups (without an agenda) – listen to people’s experiences. Don’t expect them to have all the answers, but make them part of the discussion. Don’t expect a flood of candidates overnight, but cultivate a long-term culture that makes your company attractive to people from all backgrounds.

## Do you really need all those “requirements”?

Studies show that women are less likely to apply for jobs where they don’t meet 100% of the requirements, while men will apply for jobs where they meet only a few of the requirements. If you pull a long list of “requirements” that aren’t really essential to the role, you’re already cutting out a lot of potential candidates.

## Have a robust pay policy

Too often, both starting salary and subsequent pay rises are opaque and bound up in negotiation. Study after study shows that women are missing out, frequently being paid less than their male counterparts for the same work. Make your pay policy transparent: Set out clear expecations of what work you expect an employee to be able to handle in order to achieve a specific salary. This could be done at the personal level (in employees’ reviews, for example) but is even better if you can make it public within your company.

## Review regularly

Related to the previous point, you should regularly review your employees and help them be the best that they can be. Bake these reviews into the company culture, don’t just do them on an ad-hoc basis. If an employee is struggling, understand why that is and what you can do to help. Help them set out clear action points to handle their current workload better, or to progress to the next level.

Be transparent about career progression opportunities. If they are looking for ways to progress their career and achieve that next salary milestone, set out clear objectives that they would need to meet in order for that to happen.

## In-work training and mentoring

Training is an important part of enabling employees to thrive, and web development doesn’t sit still. Employees and companies who don’t have an awareness of the latest technologies will get left behind.

## Hire juniors

## Parental leave

How you treat employees who are also parents says a lot about your company. Regardless of whether or not they want to have a baby, **women do not want to have to ask about your parental leave policies in the interview**. I cannot stress this enough. I and many other women I know have resisted asking about this, for fear of being judged as less commited to the job. Have a generous maternity and paternity leave policy, actively encourage _all_ new parents to take it (regardless of gender), and don’t for a second make assumptions about when they should or shouldn’t return to work. Someone who feels supported and confident in their job is far more likely to return to work, and work better, than someone who feels overlooked or expendible. Support them, discuss a plan with them, by all means. Don’t make them fear for their jobs while pregnant or on parental leave.

And, for goodness sake, **put it at the top of your list of company “perks”**. Spell it out _in detail_. It’s far more important than your pool table or free beer fridge.
