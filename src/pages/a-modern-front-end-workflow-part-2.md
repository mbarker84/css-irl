Parcel purports to be a “zero-config” alternative to [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), a popular Javascript module bundler. A module bundler takes separate, reusable JS files (or modules) and “bundles” them into a single file to be served to the browser, as well as minifying the output. This can improve website performance, as the browser doesn’t need to load a bunch of files individually. This in itself is very useful, but Parcel also takes care of other tasks for us out of the box, including:

- Running a local server
- Building and minifying HTML, CSS and assets
- Transpiling Javascript
- Live reloading
- Code splitting

Using Parcel, we can do everything we already did in the [previous tutorial](/a-modern-front-end-workflow-part-1) (and much more!), while writing fewer scripts! In fact, we only need two scripts to achieve everything we want.

### Creating a Parcel project

Let’s create a new project structure, similar to the one in the previous article:

```
my-awesome-project
  src
    icons
    images
    js
    scss
    index.html
  node_modules
  package.json
```

We’ll start by installing Parcel as a dependency, and we’ll also install _node-sass_ while we’re at it (multiple packages can be listed to install them at the same time):

```
npm install parcel-bundler node-sass --save-dev
```

(If you’re creating a new project, don’t forget to run `npm init` first.)

We’ll need to change the file path of our stylesheet in _index.html_. We only need to tell Parcel the relative path of our source file, as the actual path for use in production will be generated by Parcel at buildtime.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./scss/styles.scss" />
```

Parcel comes with all the commands we need to run and build our project. Simply running `parcel` plus the path to our _index.html_ file is enough to run the project and watch for changes:

```
parcel src/index.html
```

We could also (optionally) tell Parcel which port to use, and instruct it to open our website in a new browser tab whenever we start it up. The following command instructs it to use port 3000, and using the `--open` flag it will open in a new tab:

```
parcel src/index.html -p 3000 --open
```

This is a lot to type every time we want to run the project, so I like to write an NPM script for this:

```json
"scripts": {
	"start": "parcel src/index.html -p 3000 --open",
}
```

Now we only need to type `npm start`.

The second of parcel’s commands builds the website for production:

```
parcel build src/index.html
```

Again, we can write a script to execute this command too:

```json
"scripts": {
	"start": "parcel src/index.html -p 3000 --open",
	"build": "parcel build src/index.html"
}
```

Parcel’s `build` command builds all the assets to a _dist_ folder, but it doesn’t clean the folder out each time it’s run, so you can end up with duplicate files. I like to run a clean-up command before running a production build, so that we can be sure the only files built in the _dist_ directory are the ones necessary to our project.

```json
"scripts": {
	"start": "parcel src/index.html -p 3000 --open",
	"clean": "rm -rf dist/*",
	"build:parcel": "parcel build src/index.html",
	"build": "npm run clean && npm run build:parcel",
}
```

I’ve made a few small changes to our scripts:

1. The “clean” script removes everything in the _dist_ folder
2. I’ve renamed the previous “build” script “build:parcel”.
3. Now the `build` command runs the “clean” script followed by the “build:parcel” script.

Now go ahead and run `npm start`. Parcel should open your site in the browser at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) and reload the page when you make any changes to your SCSS or HTML. We don’t need Browsersync, and we don’t need to write any additional scripts.

### Adding plugins

We can add plugins (which are themselves NPM packages) to optimise images and create SVG sprites:

```
npm install parcel-plugin-imagemin parcel-plugin-svg-sprite
```

For the [parcel-plugin-imagemin](https://github.com/DeMoorJasper/parcel-plugin-imagemin) package to take effect, we need to add a config file. Add the following to a file called _imagemin.config.js_ in the project root:

```js
module.exports = {
	gifsicle: { optimizationLevel: 2, interlaced: false, colors: 10 },
	jpegtran: { progressive: true, arithmetic: false },
	pngquant: { quality: [0.25, 0.5] },
	svgo: {
		plugins: [{ removeViewBox: false }, { cleanupIDs: true }]
	},
	webp: { quality: 10 }
}
```

You can adjust the options for the desired level optimisation (see the plugin’s documentation). _parcel-plugin-svg-sprite_ should just work out-of-the-box – run the project and try adding some SVG icons to the _src/icons_ directory. You should then be able to use any of them in your HTML with the SVG `<use>` element:

```html
<svg>
	<use href="icons/my-icon.svg">
</svg>
```

## Transpiling

I like to write my JS using ES2015 syntax. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), a transpiler, converts modern Javascript to a syntax that can be read by older browsers – meaning you can write the latest JS code and have it work everywhere. That’s a pretty useful thing to include in a project starter.

Babel has a lot of different plugins and configuration options, and wading through them can feel a bit daunting. But there’s a handy package called _preset-env_ that takes care of transforming all the features of ES2015 (think arrow functions, destructuring, spread operators), which suits me just fine, so let’s install that.

```
npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env --save-dev
```

You can add other plugins if you want to configure Babel to suit your specific needs (e.g. if you’re using React, Vue or another framework).

Now we need to add a config file in the project root:

```
touch .babelrc
```

If we’re happy using the default config options then we don’t need to add much at all to our config file. The following will suffice:

```
{
	"presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

The Babel documentation has more information on [config options](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) should you need it.

Parcel runs Babel for us automatically, so once we’ve installed it and created our config file we’re good to go – our code will be transpiled whenever we run `npm run build`.

## Example

I’ve created a [starter respository](https://github.com/mbarker84/parcel-starter) using the same process as in this article – feel free to clone or fork it and use it for your projects.

## Coming up

So far in this series we’ve seen how to build a starter for very simple project using NPM scripts, and learnt how to use Parcel to handle more complex tasks with minimal configuration. In the third article we’ll add a simple Sass architecture to help us get up and running quickly with writing styles.
